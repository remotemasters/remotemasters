<p>
Remote work has been gaining popularity for many years, gradually convincing skeptics and overcoming the resistance of corporate management. 
</p>
<p>
The number of <a href="https://remotemasters.dev/remote-first-companies">remote-first</a> companies and those with <a href="https://remotemasters.dev/fully-remote-companies">fully distributed</a> engineering teams has grown steadily over the years and includes companies like GitLab, Automatic, Dribbble, Chess.com, Product Hunt, Zapier, and many others.
</p>
<p>
The global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the rate of remote work adoption, pushing many more tech companies to embrace this model (take Shopify as an example). Even giants like Google and Apple are now considering the possibility of allowing their engineers to continue working remotely after the pandemic is over. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s very likely that 2020 will be the point of no return and that, from now on, most software development teams will become distributed to some degree.
</p>
<p>
While running a distributed development team is not rocket science, itâ€™s more complicated than managing traditional, office-based teams. Many CTOs, engineering managers, and product managers were not ready for this challenge.
</p>
<p>
RemoteMasters Club was started to help all of us improve our skills at running distributed software development teams by curating relevant news, collecting best practices, and facilitating peer collaboration.
