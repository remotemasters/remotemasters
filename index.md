<p>
Remote work has being gaining in popularity for many years, gradually convincing skeptics and overcoming resistance of corporate management.
</p>
<p>
The number of <a href="https://remotemasters.dev/remote-first-companies">remote-first</a> companies and those with <a href="https://remotemasters.dev/fully-remote-companies">fully distributed</a> engineering teams grew steadily over the years and included companies like GitLab, Automatic, Dribbble, Chess.com, Product Hunt, Zapier, and many others.

</p>
<p>
The COVID pandemics has significantly increased the speed of remote work adoption, pushing many more tech companies to embrace it (take Shopify as an example). Even giants like Google and Apple consider now allowing their engineers to work remotely after the pandemics is over.

</p>
<p>
It’s very likely that 2020 will be the point of no return and most software development teams will eventually, at least to some degree, become distributed from now on.

</p>
<p>
While running a distributed development team is not rocket science, it’s usually more complicated than managing software engineers all showing up to work in one office. Many CTOs, Engineering, and Product managers were not ready for that.

</p>
<p>
RemoteMasters Club was started as a way to help all of us improve our skills at running distributed software development teams. We curate news, collect best practices, and facilitate peer collaboration.
