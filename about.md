RemoteMasters was started in May 2019 by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesvystun/'> Mike Svystun</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/obondar/'>Sasha Bondar</a> as a directory of tech companies with fully or partially distributed development teams.Over time, we also launched a job board, publishing programming jobs for remote software developers free of charge.

<p>
Now weâ€™re creating a community of software professionals looking to hone their skills at managing distributed development teams.
